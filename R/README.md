# R/
This folder contains the `R` scripts that you use for the data analysis. Rather than having one large script, we advise that you use multiple numbered scripts for specific actions, such as data cleaning, data analysis, and plotting. You can then source these scripts using a main file.

An example for the content of this folder looks like this:
- 00_main.R
- 01_cleaning.R
- 02_analysis.R
- 03_plotting.R
